# Hi, I'm Sean

I'm a Software Engineer Intern, Computer Science Student, and Student-Athlete constantly learning and building.

I have an interest in math and AI. I enjoy solving problems with tech.

I parimarily use Python, C++, C, JavaScript, and Django, but I have experience with a wide range of technologies.

I am currently learning computer networks, operating systems, graph theory, and full-stack development.

While learning graph theory, I am developing a ![graph theory library](https://github.com/smomara/graphent/).
