# Hi, I'm Sean

I'm a Student Researcher, Software Engineer Intern, Computer Science Student, and Student-Athlete constantly learning and building.

I primarily use Python, C++, C, and JavaScript, but I have experience with a wide range of technologies.

I am currently learning computer networks, operating systems, graph theory, and full-stack software engineering.
